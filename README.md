#  Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ Titanic Dataset

##  Objective  
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns in survival rates based on passenger demographics, socio-economic status, and travel details. The goal is to extract actionable insights using statistical summaries and visualizations.

##  Insights  
- **Survival rates** are significantly higher among females and first-class passengers  
- **Fare** positively correlates with survival â†’ higher-paying passengers had better outcomes  
- **Age distribution** shows younger passengers, especially children, had better survival odds  
- **Category mix** (`Pclass`, `Sex`) reveals socio-economic impact on survival  
- **Embarked location** shows slight variation in survival â†’ Southampton had most passengers  
- **Family size** (`SibSp` + `Parch`) influences survival â†’ moderate-sized families fared better

##  Visual References  
The notebook includes the following visualizations:

- **Count Plots** â€“ Survival, Pclass, Sex, Embarked  
- **Histograms** â€“ Age and Fare distributions  
- **Boxplots** â€“ Survival vs Age and Fare  
- **Pairplot** â€“ Multivariate relationships across key features  
- **Heatmap** â€“ Correlation matrix of numerical variables
